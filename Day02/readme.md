## Git and GitHub

!

## Yesterday's Crash Course...


!

## `bisection.py`

Available on the website

Run it with
```
$ python3 bisection.py
```

Make sure you are in the correct directory!

## Review Data types

!

## Review Data types

1. Strings -`'hello world'`
2. Numbers - `2.71828`

!

## Booleans

`True` or `False` within python

- `True` can also mean non-zero or non-empty or has-length (don't worry too
  much about this now)

- can use `and`, `or`, `not`, and group comparisons logically

- Unlikely to hard code these into the software

!

## Comparison Operators

- These evaluate to `True` or `False`

1. `==`         `!=` 
1. `>`            `<`
1. `>=`         `<=`

!

## Controlling program flow

```
if condition is True:
    print('true')
elif condition is False:
    print('false')
else:
    print('you will never get here')
```

!

## Data Structures

lists: `l = [1, 2, 3]`

tuples: `t = (1, 2, 3)`

sets: `s = set([1, 2, 3])`

dictionary: `d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`
